# pyTSXRD
pyTSXRD is a package for grainmapping of polycrystalline surfaces using grazing incidence Surface X-ray Diffraction (SXRD). The notebook is an example of how it can be implemented. For use for beamlines other than P21.2 at PETRA III at DESY in Hamburg, the tools might have to be adjusted.
The package is based on py3DXRD (https://github.com/agshabalin/py3DXRD/tree/main) in collaboration with the author. (https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f46248db-1eb4-41ec-981e-3f924c470dcd)
